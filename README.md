# Word Cloud

This is not really a project, just a reminder for myself.
to install the dependencies just do:

```shell script
python install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that the requirements file has additional libs in case you want to use stopwords (which I didnt).

Once the dependencies are installed then simple run:

```shell script
FILENAME=example_cloud.png python app.py
```
